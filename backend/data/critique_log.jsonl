The user wants me to make notes from the provided document. The document seems to be about IP network management, traffic management, scheduling algorithms, packet marking, traffic policing, and Little's Law. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the priority scheduling has multiple queues with different priorities. Green is high, blue medium, red low. The problem here is that low-priority queues might starve. I need to note that each scheduling method's fairness and potential issues.\n\nThen round-robin scheduling is next. It serves queues in a circular order. It's fair in the long run but may not favor high-priority customers as much. So the key points here are fairness and the order of service.\n\nWeighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) is mentioned with weights determining service units. So WFQ allows more flexibility by assigning different weights to classes. Important to note that weights influence the proportion of service each class gets.\n\nMoving on to packet marking. It's essential for differentiating classes, like coloring packets. Real-time traffic might get priority. The note here is about how marking helps in applying different policies, perhaps in the router.\n\nTraffic policing is a protection mechanism. It's a problem when applications send more traffic than agreed. Policing ensures compliance with SLA. The methods include Leaky Bucket (LB), which uses tokens to regulate traffic. If the bucket is full, non-conforming packets are marked or dropped. Important parameters are average rate (r) and burst tolerance (b). Also, policing doesn't delay packets, just marks/drops them.\n\nThe Leaky Bucket example shows how the bucket fills and empties. When the incoming rate is higher than the policing rate, the bucket fills. When it's full, excess traffic is non-conforming. The example with the 10 Mbit/s burst and 6 Mbit/s policing rate helps illustrate this. Calculating conforming and non-conforming packets here is useful.\n\nLittle's Formula connects the average number of jobs in the system (N) to the average sojourn time (S) and arrival rate (λ). The formula is E[N] = λE[S]. This is a key performance metric in queueing theory. The example with the water volume in the bucket models how traffic is regulated. The initial burst and subsequent calculation of conforming traffic percentages using the Leaky Bucket parameters.\n\nPutting this all together, the notes should cover each scheduling method (priority, round-robin, WFQ), packet marking for classification, traffic policing via Leaky Bucket with its parameters and policing mechanisms, and Little's Law as a fundamental formula for system performance. Each section needs to highlight the main concepts, their purposes, and any issues like starvation or fairness. Ensure that the Leaky Bucket example is clearly explained with the given parameters and calculations.\n</think>\n\n**Notes from Lecture 4: IP Network Management & Traffic Management**  \n*(Based on [lecture_4_2025_IP_TM.pdf](https://example.com/lecture_4_2025_IP_TM.pdf))*\n\n---\n\n### **1. Queueing Scheduling**  \n#### **Priority Scheduling**  \n- Multiple queues with priorities: **green (high)**, **blue (medium)**, **red (low)**.  \n- **Drawback**: Low-priority queues risk **starvation** if high/medium traffic dominates.  \n\n#### **Round-Robin Scheduling**  \n- Serves all queues in a **circular order** (e.g., 1 → 2 → 3 → 1…).  \n- **Fairness**: Ensures all queues get service over time, but may not prioritize high-value (e.g., real-time) traffic.  \n\n#### **Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)**  \n- Assigns **weights** to classes to determine service allocation (e.g., 1:2:3 for three queues).  \n- Balances fairness and prioritization by weight-based throughput.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Packet Marking**  \n- **Purpose**: Classifies packets into \"colors\" (e.g., green, yellow, red) for differential treatment.  \n- Example: **Real-time traffic** may be marked higher-priority.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Traffic Policing**  \n- **Goal**: Enforce **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** by preventing misbehaving traffic (e.g., excessive bandwidth usage).  \n- **Mechanisms**:  \n  - Leaky Bucket (LB), Token Bucket (TB) to regulate traffic rates.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Leaky Bucket Policing**  \n- **Parameters**:  \n  - **r**: Average rate (e.g., token generation rate).  \n  - **b**: Token bucket size (\"burst tolerance\").  \n- **Operation**:  \n  - Packets are **conforming** if tokens are available.  \n  - Excess traffic (non-conforming) is **discarded**, **marked low-priority**, or **rejected**.  \n  - **Non-delaying**: Policing does not delay packets, only filters based on the SLA.  \n\n**Example**:  \n- **Burst policing**: For a 10 Mbit/s burst over 6 Mbit/s policing rate, non-conforming packets (4/10 = 40%) are marked.  \n- **Bucket dynamics**:  \n  - Fills at 4 Mbit/s during burst, empties at 6 Mbit/s afterward.  \n  - After 2 seconds, bucket is full; subsequent packets are conforming (60%) or non-conforming (40%).  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Little’s Law (Performance Modeling)**  \n- **Formula**: **E[N] = λE[S]**  \n  - **N**: Average number of jobs in the system.  \n  - **λ**: Arrival rate.  \n  - **S**: Average sojourn time (total time in system).  \n- **Interpretation**:  \n  - Balances cost calculations (e.g., cost per job over time vs. cost per customer).  \n  - Key metric for optimizing system load (ρ = λβ < 1).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**  \n- **Scheduling vs. Policing**:  \n  - Scheduling manages **throughput fairness** (e.g., WFQ).  \n  - Policing enforces **rate compliance** (e.g., Leaky Bucket).  \n- **Traffic Classes**: Marking enables prioritization (e.g., real-time over bulk transfer).  \n- **Tradeoffs**:  \n  - Priority scheduling risks starvation.  \n  - Round-robin ensures fairness but may not prioritize critical traffic.  \n  - Leaky Bucket enforces SLAs but requires careful tuning of `r` and `b`.  \n\n---\n\n*Sources:

The user wants me to create markdown notes summarizing key concepts from the provided document on IP network management. They specified specific headings like Priority Scheduling, Round-Robin, etc., but looking at the context, some of these might not be covered. I need to make sure I only include the topics mentioned in the sources.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each source snippet to identify key points. The main topics seem to be Traffic Shaping, Traffic Policing, Leaky Bucket, Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ), Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS), and Per-Hop Behavior. The course structure mentions HTTP, FTP, MM applications, but maybe not relevant here. The first source talks about traffic management mechanisms and different traffic characteristics based on time scales.\n\nFor Traffic Shaping, there's an example with a burst being shaped from 10Mbit/s to 6Mbit/s. The Leaky Bucket is mentioned as a regulation mechanism, with an explanation of how it works with a bucket that leaks at a certain rate. The example given uses a burst of 80Mbits.\n\nWeighted Fair Queueing is discussed with weights determining service units per cycle. The visit order example shows priority classes. GPS is similar, using fluid flow approximations and weights for bandwidth allocation. The document also mentions per-hop behavior in v-aware routers, which benefits scalability but lacks absolute QoS guarantees.\n\nPacket marking is part of policing, where non-conforming packets are marked red. Contract parameters like mean rate (r) and burst tolerance (b) are part of SLA checks. Also, traffic policing vs. shaping: policing marks/exceeds, shaping delays packets.\n\nI need to organize these into headings. The user listed several, but since the context doesn't mention Round-Robin, maybe omit that. Priority Scheduling is mentioned in the example of WFQ with priorities. Maybe include that under WFQ.\n\nThe example calculation: the bursty traffic at 10Mbit/s into a 6Mbit/s shaper. The delay is calculated based on the buffer level divided by shaping rate. For the 80Mbit burst over 8 seconds, the shaping rate is 6Mbit/s, leading to specific delay calculations.\n\nI should check if there are contradictions in the sources, but all the sources here seem consistent. The main challenge is to condense all this into 200-300 words, using bullet points under each heading. Make sure definitions, parameters, pros/cons are included where applicable.\n\nLet me start drafting the markdown notes with the identified key topics: Traffic Shaping, Leaky Bucket, Weighted Fair Queueing, Generalized Processor Sharing, Traffic Policing, Per-Hop Behavior, and an example calculation for Traffic Shaping.

The user wants me to make notes from the provided context. The context has several sections from a lecture on IP network management, traffic management, scheduling, and policing. I need to extract key points concisely.\n\nFirst, looking at the sections:\n\n1. Priority Scheduling: It talks about multiple queues with different priority levels. High priority (green), medium (blue), low (red). There's a risk of starvation for low-priority queues. The source is lecture_4_2025_IP_TM.pdf, and the lecture is by Rob van der Mei.\n\n2. Round-Robin Scheduling: Queues served in circular order (1-2-3-1-2-3...). Described as fair but not great for high-priority customers who might be paying more.\n\n3. Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ): Each class has a weight determining service units. More weight means more service time, so it's a balance between fairness and priority.\n\n4. Packet Marking: Packets are marked (colored) to distinguish classes. Routers use policies to treat different traffic, like prioritizing real-time.\n\n5. Traffic Policing: Protects one class from others. Applications might exceed SLA, so policing ensures compliance. Non-conforming packets are marked or dropped. Policing doesn't delay packets.\n\n6. Leaky Bucket (LB) Implementation: Controls traffic rate. Parameters are average rate (r) and bucket size (b). Tokens represent credit. If the bucket is full, excess is non-conforming. Example calculation shows bursty traffic and how the bucket fills and drains.\n\n7. Little’s Formula: Relates average number in system (E[N]), average sojourn time (E[S]), and arrival rate (λ). Formula is E[N] = λ E[S]. It's explained using a cost analogy and relates load (ρ = λβ) to performance.\n\nI need to organize these into structured notes. Each topic should have a heading, subpoints, and key terms. Make sure to note the author and source where relevant. Avoid redundancy, and use clear language. Check if any sections contradict or overlap, but in the context, each topic seems distinct. For example, Priority, Round-Robin, and WFQ are different scheduling techniques discussed in order. Packet marking and traffic policing involve traffic management. Leaky bucket is a policing method. Little’s formula is a performance metric.\n\nAlso, the example with water volume and Mbit/s in the Leaky Bucket section: it's about how the bucket fills during bursts and drains at a certain rate. The example's numbers (initially empty, burst for 2 seconds, then draining for 9.333 seconds) illustrate the token bucket working.\n\nNeed to extract that into the notes as an example. The formula under Little’s Law mentions E[N] = λE[S], and it's related to system load (ρ = λβ < 1). The expected sojourn time is [β]/[1 - ρ], but maybe that's part of the formula mentioned? The text shows a formula with E[N] = ρ/(1-ρ), but the exact equation is in a math environment which I should represent as text.\n\nAlso, check if sources conflict. The sources all come from the same lecture, so no conflict. Now, structure the notes with each section as a point, bullet points, and key details. Make sure to mention the author and lecture title where relevant. For example, each scheduling method is from the same lecture, so group them under the same lecture info.\n\nFinal check: Did I miss any key points? The policing example with token bucket and the water volume example in the Leaky Bucket section. Also, the risk of starvation in priority queues. Yes, all covered.\n</think>\n\n**Notes from [Source: lecture_4_2025_IP_TM.pdf] by Rob van der Mei**  \n*Lecture Topic: Performance and Traffic Management in IP Networks*  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Scheduling Mechanisms**  \n- **Priority Scheduling**  \n  - Multi-queue system with ordered priorities (green = high, blue = medium, red = low).  \n  - **Risk**: Low-priority queues may experience starvation.  \n\n- **Round-Robin Scheduling**  \n  - Queues served in circular order (e.g., 1-2-3-1-2-3...).  \n  - **Fairness**: Ensures equal access over time but may not prioritize high-value traffic effectively.  \n\n- **Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)**  \n  - Assigns weights to traffic classes to allocate service units proportionally.  \n  - Balances fairness and priority by adjusting shares based on weights.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Traffic Management**  \n- **Packet Marking**  \n  - Packets are \"colored\" (e.g., via DSCP bits) to classify traffic (e.g., real-time vs. non-real-time).  \n  - Enables routers to apply differentiated policies (e.g., priority routing).  \n\n- **Traffic Policing**  \n  - **Purpose**: Enforce SLA compliance by rejecting or marking non-conforming traffic.  \n  - **Action**: Non-conforming packets are dropped or deprioritized (not delayed).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Traffic Shaping: Leaky Bucket Algorithm**  \n- **Parameters**:  \n  - **Avg. rate (`r`)**: Long-term data rate allowed.  \n  - **Burst tolerance (`b`)**: Max burst size accommodated via a token bucket.  \n- **Mechanism**:  \n  - Tokens (credit) accumulate at rate `r`.  \n  - Bursty traffic is marked non-conforming if the bucket overflows.  \n- **Example**:  \n  - Inflow: 10 Mbit/s for 2 seconds fills the bucket (capacity 8).  \n  - Outflow: 6 Mbit/s (e.g., during 9.33 seconds), with 60% traffic conforming.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Performance Metrics: Little’s Law**  \n- **Formula**:  \n  `E[N] = λ * E[S]`  \n  - `E[N]`: Average number of jobs in the system.  \n  - `λ`: Arrival rate.  \n  - `E[S]`: Average sojourn time (waiting + service time).  \n- **Interpretation**:  \n  - System load `ρ = λβ` must be <1 to avoid infinite queueing.  \n  - Expected sojourn time: `[E[S]] = β/(1−ρ)`, where `β` is service rate.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Key Design Considerations**  \n- **Trade-offs**: Fairness (Round-Robin) vs. priority (Priority/WFQ).  \n- **Mitigation of Abuse**: Traffic policing enforces SLAs to prevent bandwidth violations.  \n- **User-Perceived Performance**: Traffic management impacts latency, jitter, and availability for real-time applications.  \n\n---\n\n**Author**: Rob van der Mei  \n**Lecture Focus**: Balancing

Define a Continuous‑Time Markov Chain (CTMC) for the system state (e.g., number of busy lines).  \n  2. Write balance (rate‑in = rate‑out) equations.  \n  3. Solve for the steady‑state probabilities π₀,…,π_N.  \n  4. Use **PASTA** (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) to turn state probabilities into performance measures.  \n  5. Express blocking, loss, or delay probabilities in terms of the π’s.\n\n- **Reliability modelling**  \n  - **Lifetime / Time‑to‑Failure (TTF)** random variable X, reliability function R(t)=P{X>t}.  \n  - **Hazard Rate (HRF)** h(t)=lim_{Δt→0}P{failure in [t,t+Δt]|survival to t}/Δt – “bathtub curve” shape.  \n  - **Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)** – average life of a component or system.\n\n- **Concrete example – DBMS hot‑standby reliability**  \n  - Two active DB servers (DB1, DB2) each with **MTTF = 12 months** → exponential rate λ₁ = λ₂ = 1/12 month⁻¹.  \n  - **System failure** occurs when the *first* server fails (hot‑standby takes over).  \n    - Total failure rate λ = λ₁ + λ₂ = 1/6 month⁻¹ → system TTF ∼ Exp(1/6).  \n    - **Probabilities** derived from the exponential CDF:  \n      - P{TTF > 6 months} ≈ 37 %  \n      - P{TTF > 12 months} ≈ 14 %  \n      - P{TTF > 60 months} ≈ 0.054 %  \n  - If the standby is *idle* (cold‑standby) the system lifetime becomes the **sum** of two exponentials (Erlang‑2), giving a larger mean (≈ 24 months) and different reliability numbers (not fully reproduced in the excerpt).\n\n- **Other illustrative material**  \n  - Historical telephony traffic problem (New York ↔ Chicago) → leads to Erlang’s birth‑rate model.  \n  - “Frustrations” slide (soccer anecdotes) – just a light‑hearted filler.  \n  - References for deeper study: *O.J. Boxma, Stochastic Performance Modelling* (chapters 1‑3).\n\n- **Take‑away for a beginner**  \n  - Performance modelling starts by **identifying random events** (arrivals, failures, service times) and choosing an appropriate **probability distribution**.  \n  - **Markov chains** and the **Erlang formulas** turn those probabilistic descriptions into concrete metrics such as **blocking probability** or **system reliability**.  \n  - Simple numerical examples (e.g., hot‑standby DBMS) show how the theory translates into **real‑world design decisions** (how many redundant servers are needed to achieve a target availability?).", "context": ["for education purposes, to understand networking)\n• The TCP/IP model is a 4-layer practical model, forms the basis for the Internet, built \non specific protocols (TCP, UDP and IP), actually used for Internet communication\n• The TCP/IP stack is a concrete implementation of the TCP/IP model\nTCP/IP stack\n\nLecture 2: Introduction to performance modeling © Rob van der Mei\nA Brief History of Time…\nlocal network\n switching center\n• The good-old days of Graham Bell… \nLecture 2: Introduction to performance modeling © Rob van der Mei\n       \n1892\nNew York\nChicago\nInter-regional \nconnection\nInter-Regional Calls…\nA\nB\nLecture 2: Introduction to performance modeling © Rob van der Mei\nThe First Traffic Problems…\n“New York”\n“Chicago”\nA\nB\nC\nD\nHow many \nlines ?\nLecture 2: Introduction to performance modelin", "nts application\nserver\ndatabase \nservers \nDB1 DB2\nhot \nstand-by\nGreat impact of “hot standby” … but how to calculate these figures?\n© Rob van der MeiLecture 2: Introduction to performance modeling\nDBMS Reliability Design\nSuppose: MTTF = 12 months for \neach active server\nThen\n1.

The layers are:\n\n1. Physical (hardware, cables)\n2. Data Link (medium access control, synchronization, error checking)\n3. Network (switching, routing between nodes)\n4. Transport (flow control, data transfer between end systems)\n5. Session (establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications)\n6. Presentation (transforms data into the form that the application layer can accept)\n7. Application (supports application and end-user processes)\n\nThe document also discusses the application view of the network, where pairs of processes communicate via streams/channels, and the TCP protocol provides a model for this communication.\n\n**Lecture 2: Introduction to Performance Modeling**\n\nThis document builds on the previous lecture and introduces the concept of performance modeling. It discusses the OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model, which is a 4-layer practical model used for the Internet.\n\nThe document also mentions the Leaky Bucket (LB) implementation, which is a traffic policing mechanism that enforces a traffic contract by discarding or marking non-conforming packets.\n\n**Lecture 4: Performance and Traffic Management in IP Networks**\n\nThis document focuses on performance and traffic management in IP networks. It discusses the Leaky Bucket implementation in more detail, including how it works and its parameters (average rate, burst tolerance).\n\nThe document also introduces the concept of traffic policing, which is performed to enforce traffic contracts and prevent network congestion. It explains how policing works, including the calculation of the fraction of conforming and non-conforming packets.\n\nAdditionally, the document discusses packet classification, which is used to differentiate between priority classes of traffic. It mentions the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) approach, which defines a small number of priority classes and implements per-hop behavior packet forwarding.\n\n**Lecture 1: Introduction to Communication Networking (again)**\n\nThis document is a repeat of the first lecture, but it includes additional information on IP as a generic protocol that runs over all networks, and the \"hour-glass model\" of the OSI reference model.\n\n**Lecture 4: Performance and Traffic Management in IP Networks (again)**\n\nThis document is a repeat of the fourth lecture, but it includes additional information on packet level models, including voice and data transfers. It also discusses the fluid approximation model for file transfers and the processor sharing (PS) model for TCP elastic traffic.\n\n**Wrap-Up and Additional Topics**\n\nThe final document is a wrap-up of the lectures, and it includes additional topics such as content delivery networks (CDNs), latency, and bandwidth. It also mentions Google's CDN and its hierarchical structure, and discusses why latency is the bottleneck for websites.\n\nOverall, the documents provide a comprehensive introduction to communication

The distinction between leaky‑bucket and token‑bucket is omitted.\n- Traffic policing vs. shaping is only superficially described; no explanation of how shaping smooths traffic or the typical algorithms used.\n- The comparison between OSI and TCP/IP could be richer (e.g., mapping of layers).\n- CDN architecture is reduced to “bring content closer”; no mention of edge servers, caching hierarchy, or DNS redirection.\n- The requested organization per lecture is inconsistent: Lecture 1 appears twice, Lecture 3 is absent, and Lecture 4 is the only one covering traffic management.\n\n### Clarity\n- The markdown headings are present, but the repetition of *Lecture 1* creates confusion.\n- Bullet points are concise but sometimes lack context (e.g., “Leaky‑bucket policing uses a token‑bucket mechanism” is contradictory without clarification).\n- Overall readability is decent, but the answer does not fully satisfy the “concise yet thorough” requirement within the 300‑400‑word limit.\n\n### Hallucination Risk\n- No obvious hallucinations; the answer stays within the provided material.

It covers various topics related to Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic management in IP networks.\n\nThe document can be divided into several sections:\n\n1. **Leaky Bucket Implementation**: This section explains the Leaky Bucket algorithm, which is a simple traffic policing mechanism. It describes how the algorithm works, including the concept of tokens, burst tolerance, and conforming and non-conforming packets.\n\n2. **Traffic Policing**: This section provides an overview of traffic policing, which is a mechanism to enforce traffic contracts. It explains how policing works, including the concept of regulated and non-conforming packets.\n\n3. **Traffic Policing Example**: This section provides an example of how the Leaky Bucket algorithm works in practice. It describes a scenario where a burst of traffic exceeds the policing rate, and how the algorithm marks non-conforming packets.\n\n4. **Admission Control (CAC)**: This section explains the concept of Admission Control, which is a mechanism to ensure that the network does not overload. It describes how CAC works, including the concept of link capacity and QoS agreements.\n\n5. **Packet Classification**: This section introduces the concept of packet classification, which is a mechanism to classify packets into different priority classes. It describes the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) approach, which defines a small number of priority classes.\n\n6. **QoS Functionalities of Routers**: This section explains the various QoS functionalities that routers can implement, including shaping, policing, classification, and queueing strategies.\n\n7. **Packet Level Models**: This section provides an overview of packet level models, including the fluid approximation and the processor sharing (PS) model. It also describes the concept of silence suppression in voice telephony.\n\nOverall, this document provides a comprehensive overview of QoS and traffic management in IP networks, covering various topics and mechanisms related to traffic policing, admission control, packet classification, and queueing strategies.", "context": ["Mei\n• Leaky Bucket (LB) implementation\n– r is average rate, b = size of token bucket (“burst tolerance”)\n• Number of tokens represents amount of credit of packets the arrive at \nfaster rate than the agreed-upon mean rate r\n• During period of T seconds, LB declares at most b+Tr bytes as “conforming” \n• Non-conforming packets are marked (e.g., discarded, or given low-priority)\nTraffic Policing\nNote: packets are NOT delayed\nin policing, they are only \ndiscarded or marked\nPolicing is performed to \nenforce traffic contract\nmaximum b \ntokensnumber of \ntokens in \nbucket\n1 token added every \n1/r time unitsincoming traffic \n(irregular)\n“regulated” \ntraffic\nnon-conforming \npackets are \nmarked red\n“SLA \ncheck”\nduring bursts, \npeak rate \nexceeds r\nPackets marked as \n“conforming” if \ntoken available\nCo", "t length \n(seconds)\n8\n0\n0\n2\nwater volume rises at \nrate 10-6 = 4 Mbit/s\nbucket \nis full\n8\n0\nbucket empty again after \n28/3 = 9.333 seconds \nwater volume decreases \nat rate 6 Mbit/s\nduring this period: inflow = 10 Mbit/s, outflow = 6 \nMbit/s → % conforming = 6/10, % non-conforming = \n4/10 \nbucket is full \nafter 2 seconds during the first two \nseconds, all\npackets \nare conforming\n80 2\nbetween 2 and 8 seconds, a fraction \n6/10 is conforming, and the remaining  \nfraction 4/10 non-conforming\ninitially, the \nbucket is empty\n“volume of water in the bucket” models \ntraffic sent in excess of the policing rate \n(“credit”)\nTraffic Policing: \nExample for a single traffic burst\nbitrate \n(in Mbit /s)\nThe way leaky bucket policing works:\n1.When burst rate > policing rate => water level in the bucket rise", "onnection”) Admission Control (CAC)\nProblem: One can not support traffic beyond \nlink capacity\nApplication flow declares its needs, the network \nmay reject call if it cannot satisfy needs\nIf the network accepts too many “calls”, then QoS agreements \nwith other customers may be violated (leading to fines)\nCAC functionality\nLecture 4: Performance and traffic management in IP networks © Rob van der Mei\nPacket Classification\nDifferentiated Services (“DiffServ”)\n• Definition of small number of priority classes\n– For example: low-latency (voice, streaming), best-effort (Web, file transfer)\n• DiffServ-aware routers implement “per-hop behavior” packet \nforwarding \n• Benefit: scalability no issue\n• Drawback: performance only relative, no absolute QoS guarantees\nA B\npriority classes\nLecture 4: Perfo", "ng rate \n(“credit”)\nTraffic Policing: \nExample for a single traffic burst\nbitrate \n(in Mbit /s)\nThe way leaky bucket policing works:\n1.When burst rate > policing rate => water level in the bucket rises\n2.When water volume = burst tolerance (that is: “the bucket is full”) only a fraction “f” of the packets are \nmarked conforming and the other packets as non-conforming\n3.Fraction conforming “f” is given by f = policing rate / peak rate, and fraction non-conforming by 1-f = \n(peak rate – policing rate) / peak rate \nLecture 4: Performance and traffic management in IP networks © Rob van der Mei\nQoS Functionalities of Routers\nIdea: Routers can implements all kinds of QoS mechanisms\nshaping\npolicing\nclassification\nshaper\ndelays flows\nqueueing strategy\norganisation of router’s buffers\nclassifier\ni", "during silences, 0 kbit/s\ntime\n“bursts”\n64 kbit/s\nFor data transfers:\n“fluid \napproximation”\n1.

For example, if the peak rate is 10 Mbit/s and the policing rate is 5 Mbit/s, the fraction conforming is 5/10 = 0.5, meaning 50% of packets are marked as conforming and 50% as non-conforming.\n* **Traffic Policing**: Traffic policing works by verifying whether incoming flows adhere to rules, and marking packets as conforming or non-conforming based on the policing rate and peak rate. Conforming packets are allowed to pass through, while non-conforming packets are discarded or marked as such.\n* **Admission Control (CAC)**: Admission control is a mechanism that prevents traffic from exceeding link capacity by rejecting calls if the network cannot satisfy the requested needs. This ensures that QoS agreements with other customers are not violated.\n* **DiffServ Packet Classification**: DiffServ packet classification defines a small number of priority classes, such as low-latency (voice, streaming) and best-effort (Web, file transfer). DiffServ-aware routers implement per-hop behavior packet forwarding based on these priority classes.\n* **QoS Functionalities of Routers**: Routers can implement various QoS mechanisms, including shaping, policing, classification, queueing, and buffer organization.

It covers various topics related to Quality of Service (QoS) and traffic management in IP networks.\n\nThe document is divided into several sections, each discussing a different aspect of QoS and traffic management. The sections include:\n\n1. Leaky Bucket Implementation: This section explains the concept of leaky bucket policing, which is a method used to control traffic and ensure that it conforms to a predetermined rate. The leaky bucket model is used to represent the amount of credit or tokens available for a particular flow.\n\n2. Traffic Policing: This section explains the concept of traffic policing, which is a method used to enforce traffic contracts and ensure that traffic conforms to a predetermined rate. Traffic policing is performed by checking the rate of incoming traffic against a predetermined policing rate.\n\n3. Admission Control (CAC): This section explains the concept of admission control, which is a method used to determine whether a new flow can be admitted into the network. Admission control is used to ensure that the network can support the new flow without violating QoS agreements with other customers.\n\n4. Packet Classification: This section explains the concept of packet classification, which is a method used to classify packets into different priority classes. Packet classification is used to provide differentiated services to different types of traffic.\n\n5. QoS Functionalities of Routers: This section explains the various QoS functionalities that can be implemented in routers, including shaping, policing, classification, shaper, delays flows, queueing strategy, and organisation of router's buffers.\n\n6. Packet Level Models: This section explains the concept of packet level models, which are used to model the behavior of different types of traffic, including voice and data transfers.\n\nThe document appears to be a comprehensive overview of QoS and traffic management in IP networks, covering various topics and concepts related to these areas.\n\nSome key takeaways from the document include:\n\n* Leaky bucket policing is a method used to control traffic and ensure that it conforms to a predetermined rate.\n* Traffic policing is a method used to enforce traffic contracts and ensure that traffic conforms to a predetermined rate.\n* Admission control is a method used to determine whether a new flow can be admitted into the network.\n* Packet classification is a method used to classify packets into different priority classes.\n* QoS functionalities can be implemented in routers to provide differentiated services to different types of traffic.\n* Packet level models can be used to model the behavior of different types of traffic, including voice and data transfers.", "context": ["Mei\n• Leaky Bucket (LB) implementation\n– r is average rate, b = size of token bucket (“burst tolerance”)\n• Number of tokens represents amount of credit of packets the arrive at \nfaster rate than the agreed-upon mean rate r\n• During period of T seconds, LB declares at most b+Tr bytes as “conforming” \n• Non-conforming packets are marked (e.g., discarded, or given low-priority)\nTraffic Policing\nNote: packets are NOT delayed\nin policing, they are only \ndiscarded or marked\nPolicing is performed to \nenforce traffic contract\nmaximum b \ntokensnumber of \ntokens in \nbucket\n1 token added every \n1/r time unitsincoming traffic \n(irregular)\n“regulated” \ntraffic\nnon-conforming \npackets are \nmarked red\n“SLA \ncheck”\nduring bursts, \npeak rate \nexceeds r\nPackets marked as \n“conforming” if \ntoken available\nCo", "t length \n(seconds)\n8\n0\n0\n2\nwater volume rises at \nrate 10-6 = 4 Mbit/s\nbucket \nis full\n8\n0\nbucket empty again after \n28/3 = 9.333 seconds \nwater volume decreases \nat rate 6 Mbit/s\nduring this period: inflow = 10 Mbit/s, outflow = 6 \nMbit/s → % conforming = 6/10, % non-conforming = \n4/10 \nbucket is full \nafter 2 seconds during the first two \nseconds, all\npackets \nare conforming\n80 2\nbetween 2 and 8 seconds, a fraction \n6/10 is conforming, and the remaining  \nfraction 4/10 non-conforming\ninitially, the \nbucket is empty\n“volume of water in the bucket” models \ntraffic sent in excess of the policing rate \n(“credit”)\nTraffic Policing: \nExample for a single traffic burst\nbitrate \n(in Mbit /s)\nThe way leaky bucket policing works:\n1.When burst rate > policing rate => water level in the bucket rise", "onnection”) Admission Control (CAC)\nProblem: One can not support traffic beyond \nlink capacity\nApplication flow declares its needs, the network \nmay reject call if it cannot satisfy needs\nIf the network accepts too many “calls”, then QoS agreements \nwith other customers may be violated (leading to fines)\nCAC functionality\nLecture 4: Performance and traffic management in IP networks © Rob van der Mei\nPacket Classification\nDifferentiated Services (“DiffServ”)\n• Definition of small number of priority classes\n– For example: low-latency (voice, streaming), best-effort (Web, file transfer)\n• DiffServ-aware routers implement “per-hop behavior” packet \nforwarding \n• Benefit: scalability no issue\n• Drawback: performance only relative, no absolute QoS guarantees\nA B\npriority classes\nLecture 4: Perfo", "ng rate \n(“credit”)\nTraffic Policing: \nExample for a single traffic burst\nbitrate \n(in Mbit /s)\nThe way leaky bucket policing works:\n1.When burst rate > policing rate => water level in the bucket rises\n2.When water volume = burst tolerance (that is: “the bucket is full”) only a fraction “f” of the packets are \nmarked conforming and the other packets as non-conforming\n3.Fraction conforming “f” is given by f = policing rate / peak rate, and fraction non-conforming by 1-f = \n(peak rate – policing rate) / peak rate \nLecture 4: Performance and traffic management in IP networks © Rob van der Mei\nQoS Functionalities of Routers\nIdea: Routers can implements all kinds of QoS mechanisms\nshaping\npolicing\nclassification\nshaper\ndelays flows\nqueueing strategy\norganisation of router’s buffers\nclassifier\ni", "during silences, 0 kbit/s\ntime\n“bursts”\n64 kbit/s\nFor data transfers:\n“fluid \napproximation”\n1.
